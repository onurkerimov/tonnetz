# Tonnetz: Interactive Music Theory Visualization (Work in Progress)

- Main interface: https://tonnetz-playground.vercel.app/iframe.html?args=&id=components-musicinterface--default&viewMode=story
- Individual components: https://tonnetz-playground.vercel.app/

An interactive web application that visualizes musical relationships through the lens of Tonnetz (tone-network) theory, built with React, TypeScript, and Vite.

## Overview

This project is an ongoing exploration of the Tonnetz, a geometric representation of pitch relationships that was first described by Leonhard Euler and later expanded by Hugo Riemann. The Tonnetz represents pitch classes in a two-dimensional lattice, where:

- Horizontal steps represent perfect fifth intervals
- Diagonal steps represent major or minor third intervals
- Triangular regions represent major and minor triads

## Features

- üéπ Interactive Piano Interface
- üî∑ Dynamic Hexagonal/Rectangular Tonnetz Visualization
- üéµ Customizable Note Display
